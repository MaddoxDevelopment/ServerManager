API to combine all cloud API's into a single one.

The project was made for a demonstration to show a decent way to write a new application that may have 3rd party API dependencies.

The main idea here is to reduce coupling between services and have the ability to switch out implementations with ease.

Configuration is not included in the repo, you must add your own api key and project id to appsettings.json.
